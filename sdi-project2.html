<p>I chose dragons and wizards for this assignment. In the spirit of the many books and movies I have absorbed on this subject, I thought it would be fun to do this in the format of a simplistic game.</p>
<p>Each dragon will have certain hit points. Each wizard will have attack points. This will compare the dragons hit points to the wizards attack points to see if the wizard can defeat the dragon without the multistep battle ensueing. Otherwise they battle.</p>
<p>I wanted to add some randomness to it.</p>
