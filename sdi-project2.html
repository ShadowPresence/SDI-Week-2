<p>I chose dragons and wizards for this assignment. In the spirit of the many books and movies I have absorbed on this subject, I thought it would be fun to do this in the format of a simplistic game.</p>
<p>Each dragon will have certain hit points. Each wizard will have attack points. This will analyze which wizard can handle which dragon.</p>
<p>I wanted to add some randomness to it.</p>
